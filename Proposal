# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Advanced Pong"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game of ping pong where it gets harder and harder for the user to keep up with the cpu

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

At first we will start off easy by letting the user get used to the controls and rules. Once they are comfortable, they will continue onto the next level which will have a faster ball pace. Then the next level will be a smaller paddle. The next level will be combining the previous 2 levels into one with even faster ball pace

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Josh Christian, tul60645@temple.edu, Rahad Arman Nabid
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome is that no one will be able to beat the cpu

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

a better outcome is not even another cpu would be able to beat it

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be that our game blows up as hardest game of ping pong on the planet

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps would be to start creating a normal game of ping pong and then slowly add more to it as we go on. We would need to do a lot of research on code for pong and how to alter all the settings manually and manipulate them the way we want them to be. Ryan and I plan on meeting up to do the project together in the library where we will do our work. Only one person needs to be coding while the other should be making sure the code is correct and what the code should be doing.
